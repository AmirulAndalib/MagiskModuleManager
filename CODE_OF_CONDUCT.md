## Recommendations about conflict

Due to the environment being a community, socials interactions are bound to happen,
in such case please follow these steps in order to ensure the conflict is respectful 
and does not harm the community or any of it's members:

### 1. Make sure the conflict is not an healthy conflict

Often it can be hard to differentiate a healthy and non healthy conflict,
making sure both parties are respectful and not causing harm to each other 
is the first thing to check.

### 2. Checking if the conflict can't be deescalated

Check if the conflict can be deescalated, this doesn't mean stopping the 
discussion, but rather trying to turn something heated and stressful into 
something healthy and relaxing.

### 3. Shutting down the conflict

When nothing else can be done, locking a conversation or applying disciplinary 
action may be needed to avoid further spreading of unhealthy conflicts through 
the entire community.

## Ideas and goals behind this code of conduct

The main goal of this code of conduct is to protect psychological state of 
members of the community, since strict rules may cause stress that may impact
psychological state, reducing productivity, and amplifying compulsive behavior.

This code of conduct also acknowledge that peoples can be compulsive under
reduced mental capacity that can be caused by thing such as: Sugar, alcohol,
lack of sleep, and emotional distress.

As such, having a moderated relaxing environment without strict rules help 
achieving these goals.
